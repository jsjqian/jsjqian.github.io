  <p>Hi,</p>
  <p>I'm Jack Qian.</p>
  <p>I'm a student, a software developer, and a human.</p>
  <p>Most of my time is spent studying Computer Science and Finance at the University of Maryland College Park. I also run a club called <a href="terrapinfreelancers.com">Terrapin Freelancers</a> and am one of the co-founders.</p>
  <p>I believe in collaboration and turning ideas into reality which usually lands me at hackathons. Like everyone else, I have my favorite set of tools, but I love to learn and can pick up new languages and technologies quickly.
  <p>Right now, I'm looking for a software engineering internship for the summer. If you're looking for a capable candidate, check out my projects and résumé down below.</p>
  <p>I can't wait to meet you.</p>
